# Single Linked List

A singly linked list is a type of linked list where each node contains a value and a pointer/reference to the next node in the list.
The last node in the list points to NULL, indicating the end of the list.

## Why use a singly linked list:

1. Dynamic Size: Singly linked lists have a dynamic size, meaning they can grow or shrink as needed. Nodes can be easily added or removed from the list without requiring contiguous memory allocation.

2. Insertion and Deletion: Singly linked lists excel at efficient insertion and deletion operations, particularly at the beginning or end of the list. Adding or removing a node requires updating only a few pointers, making these operations relatively fast.

3. Memory Efficiency: Singly linked lists can be more memory-efficient compared to arrays when dealing with variable-sized data. Nodes in a linked list can be allocated independently, allowing efficient use of memory resources.

4. Flexibility: Singly linked lists allow for flexibility in data organization. Each node can store additional information beyond just the value, such as metadata or references to other data structures.

## When to use a singly linked list:

1. Dynamic Data: When the size of the data is not known in advance, or when the data size may change frequently, a singly linked list can be a good choice. It allows for efficient insertion and deletion of elements.

2. Insertion/Deletion Operations: If your application involves frequent insertion or deletion operations, especially at the beginning or end of the list, a singly linked list can provide better performance compared to an array.

3. Memory Efficiency: If memory efficiency is a concern, particularly when dealing with variable-sized data, a singly linked list can be more efficient than an array.

4. Flexibility in Data Structure: If you need to store additional information or maintain references to other data structures alongside the main values, a singly linked list can provide the necessary flexibility.
