# Single Linked Lists vs Arrays

Linked lists and arrays are both data structures used to store and organize data. Each has its own advantages and use cases. Here's a comparison of linked lists and arrays and when to use each:

Arrays:

- Arrays are fixed in size and have a contiguous block of memory.
- Elements in an array are accessed using an index.
- Arrays provide constant-time access to elements based on their index.
- Insertion and deletion operations can be inefficient as elements may need to be shifted.
- Arrays are suitable when the size of the data is known in advance and doesn't change frequently, and when quick access to elements by index is required.

Linked Lists:

- Linked lists consist of nodes where each node contains data and a reference to the next node.
- Nodes in a linked list are scattered in memory and connected through pointers.
- Elements in a linked list are accessed by traversing the list from the head node.
- Linked lists provide efficient insertion and deletion operations as they only require updating pointers.
- Linked lists are suitable when the size of the data may change dynamically or when frequent insertion and deletion operations are expected.
