# doubly linked lists

A doubly linked list is a type of data structure that consists of a sequence of nodes, where each node contains two references or pointers: one pointing to the previous node and another pointing to the next node in the sequence. This bidirectional linkage allows traversal in both directions, forward and backward, within the list.

To use a doubly linked list, you typically need to define a node structure or class that contains the necessary attributes, such as the data value and the references to the previous and next nodes. You then manipulate these nodes to perform operations such as insertion, deletion, and traversal within the list.
